# Installing #

Download the .deb file from the [downloads page](http://code.google.com/p/phonix/downloads/list) and save it in the location of your choice.

Install the .deb file as root with the following command:

`dpkg -i phonix_$VERSION_i386.deb`

Phonix requires a recent version of the mono runtime, which dpkg should be able to install automatically for you.

# Running #

Once phonix has been installed, you can invoke it by simply typing:

`phonix [args]`
