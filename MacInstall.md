# Installing #

Phonix requires a recent version of the Mono runtime. Installation instructions for Mono on MacOSX can be found at [the Mono project website](http://www.mono-project.com/Mono:OSX).

Once you have installed Mono, download the .zip file from the [downloads page](http://code.google.com/p/phonix/downloads/list) and save it in the location of your choice.

Right-click on the .zip file and select "Expand all...". (The exact wording of this menu option may depend on your version of OSX.) This will expand a folder containing the phonix executables, documentation, and examples.

# Running #

Open up a Terminal window. You can do this by going to Spotlight and searching for "Terminal", then clicking on the Terminal app when it appears. In the terminal window, navigate to the directory where you unzipped the phonix files. Once you are in that directory, you can invoke phonix by typing:

`mono phonix.exe [args]`.
